Core Memory:
Your core memory unit will be initially empty. You can add to it important information about the task or your status. Keep it concise and remember that you will use it to guide your actions, so keep it relevant!
You can add to your core memory using the <memory_add> action.
For example, <memory_add> The user is working on a project to create a new AI assistant. </memory_add>
Adding to your core memory is optional. You do NOT need to do it for every message.
