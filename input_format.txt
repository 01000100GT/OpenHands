# History of all previous interactions with the task:

## step 1

Ouput thought and action: Let's think step-by-step. To find the cheapest blue kayak, I need to perform a search using the keyword "blue kayak" and then review the results. First, I will fill in the search textbox with the keyword "blue kayak". In summary, the next action I will perform is ```fill('56', 'blue kayak')```

## step 2
... (subsequent steps not shown)

# Action space:
Note: This action set allows you to interact with your environment. Most of them are python function executing playwright code. The primary way of referring to elements in the page is through bid which are specified in your observations.


20 different types of actions are available.

noop(wait_ms: float = 1000)
send_msg_to_user(text: str)
scroll(delta_x: float, delta_y: float)
fill(bid: str, value: str)

# Abstract Example

Here is an abstract version of the answer with description of the content of each tag. Make sure you follow this structure, but replace the content with your answer:

You must mandatorily think step by step. If you need to make calculations such as coordinates, write them here. Describe the effect that your previous action had on the current content of the page. In summary the next action I will perform is ```One single action to be executed. You can only use one action at a time.```

# Concrete Example

Here is a concrete example of how to format your answer. Make sure to generate the action in the correct format ensuring that the action is present inside ``````:

Let's think step-by-step. From previous action I tried to set the value of year to "2022", using select_option, but it doesn't appear to be in the form. It may be a dynamic dropdown, I will try using click with the bid "324" and look at the response from the page. In summary the next action I will perform is ```click('324')```
