# App Browser

The App Browser is a feature in OpenHands that allows you to monitor and verify the AI agent's web interactions in real-time. When the agent performs actions in a web browser (like navigating to URLs, clicking buttons, or filling forms), the App Browser displays screenshots of what the agent sees, helping you ensure that the agent is interacting with web pages correctly.

## Features

- **URL Display**: Shows the current URL the agent is visiting
- **Live Screenshots**: Displays real-time screenshots of the web pages the agent is interacting with
- **Visual Verification**: Helps you verify that the agent's web interactions are working as intended

## How It Works

1. When the agent performs web interactions using the `browser` tool, it captures screenshots of the web pages
2. These screenshots are displayed in the App Browser panel in real-time
3. You can see exactly what the agent sees, making it easier to debug or verify web interactions

## Use Cases

The App Browser is particularly useful when:

- Debugging web automation tasks
- Verifying that the agent is interacting with the correct elements on a page
- Ensuring web scraping or form filling tasks are working correctly
- Monitoring the agent's progress during web-based tasks

## Location

You can find the App Browser panel in the OpenHands UI. It displays "No page loaded" when the agent is not currently performing any web interactions.
